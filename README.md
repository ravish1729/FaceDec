# FaceDec
vid.py is the code I am working on<br>
Used RetinaFace for face detection<br>
For face recognition model has to be trained. So, execute encode_faces.py for same<br>
And in dataset folder there is folder with name of every person you want to detect, add images of that person in folder of his name<br>
Then execute this program<br>
It will start detecting faces<br>
