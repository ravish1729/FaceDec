# FaceDec
vid.py is the code I am working on
Used RetinaFace for face detection
For face recognition model has to be trained. So, execute encode_faces.py for same
And in dataset folder there is folder with name of every person you want to detect, add images of that person in folder of his name
Then execute this program
It will start detecting faces
